        <p>I live in upstate New York. 
          I enjoy the outdoors, making stained glass, puzzles, and games. 
          I've always had a passion for riddles and puzzles which led me to web development.
          I thoroughly enjoy the process of identifying what is needed, determining the steps to get the desired result, and achieving the solution.  
          I believe any problem can be solved with the right tools and seen from the proper perspective. I'd like to use my knowledge of HTML, JavaScript, jQuery, and CSS to solve your problems.
